# EXPLICIT RELATIVE PATHS
i understood from my research that implicit relative path means..im using the name of current working directory
to call it..but not specified as thats what relative path is about..(challenge/run) but explicit we use . to efer to curent working
directory and .. for parent directory{just above current directory}..so i used cd / to make it the / directory..and type ./challenge/run as thats waht
explicit relative path is
``` bash
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!

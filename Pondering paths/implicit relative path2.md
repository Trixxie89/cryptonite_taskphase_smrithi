# IMPLICIT RELATIVE PATH
here we had to make it cd /challenge as specifiied in Q ..then it told to use . to do..here . means current directuory
so just type ./run which means the relative path.
```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4cz0eI8N6B4v3MScW4Qew1svlsL.dFTN1QDL1MjN0czW}
```

# REDIRECTING SCRIPT O/P
used nano x.sh to make the text editor typed this
#!/bin/bash
/challenge/pwn
/challenge/college
used chmod to make it executanle..
then i did piping..so i took o?p of bash x.sh as input for ths /challenge/solve
``` bash
                                                                            Connected!
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
bash: x.sh: No such file or directory
The data piped from /challenge/pwn did not match what I expected. I
re-randomize the data every time you input a new line to the shell, so you must
get it right in one shot! Make sure to pipe the output from your script to
/challenge/solve.
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gm7KfB-MvTRQ61UzW1zO3VdoOf_.dhTM5QDL1MjN0czW}
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$

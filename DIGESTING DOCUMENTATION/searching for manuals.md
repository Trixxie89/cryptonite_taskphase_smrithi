# SEARCHING FOR MANUALS
here i learnt a new argument of using -k ..which provides a list of manual pages containing some keyword
so i used thhat and i got the argument which has flag and done it.
``` bash
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man -k challenge
jalpovdxhz (1)       - print the flag!
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ /challenge
ssh-entrypoint: /challenge: Is a directory
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$
```
I asked help from one of my peers to solve this..and she was the one who suggested this -k

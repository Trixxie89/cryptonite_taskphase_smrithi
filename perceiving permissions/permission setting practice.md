# permission setting practice
so here i reuired to change permissoions as told..i took ths from wiki for references
u: user (owner)
g: group
o: others
r: read
w: write
x: execute
=: set exact permissions (overrides existing ones)
-: remove permissions
chmod u=rwx,g=-,o=w /challenge/pwn: Sets user permissions to read..write,..and execute...removes group permissions; and it leats others to write.
like this i made each command
``` bash
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ /challenge/run

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod a=rwx /flag

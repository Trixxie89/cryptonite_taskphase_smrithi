You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions

You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it
in the file /lib/kernel/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into that
directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/kernel/flag
